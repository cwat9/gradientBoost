# gradientBoost

This is a project assigned during my CSE 176 Machine Learning course
at the University of California, Merced. This program has 2 components,
a classification analysis and a regression analysis.

For our classification analysis, we will be using the Bank Marketing
dataset from the University of California, Irvine
(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222/bank+marketing).
Named ```bank.csv```

For our regression
analysis, we will be using Apple's ($AAPL) stock history from Yahoo Finance.
Data recorded from Apple's inception to November 2023. This was acquired using 
Python's YFinance library.
Named ```hist.csv```
